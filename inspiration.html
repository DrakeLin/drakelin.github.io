			<h2>Inspiration</h2>
			<p>The human condition fascinates me. Why do we act the way we do? What drives us? Each piece of art reflects the author's view on these ideas. 
			The following are some of the works I found inspirational. Science fiction is a genre I gravitate towards but no so much for its tech stuff.
			Good science fiction works don't so much as look out as they look in. They take extreme circumstances and see how humanity responds.
			Note, my imagination is weak (I can't visualize multiple subject, scenes, or movement) so I am biased towards movies and video games. 
			In my opinion, video games are one of the strongest storytelling genres, forcing us to fully embrace and engage with the narrative. </p>
