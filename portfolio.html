					<h3 id="databricks">Databricks</h3>
					<span>August 2023 - Present</span>
				</header>
				<p>
					As a Software Engineer at Databricks, I develop cloud storage and credentials infrastructure powering the SAAS enterprise platform. My work includes
					building an automated multi-cloud blob storage provisioning system that manages over 1,000,000 buckets and 500+ TB of customer data across 100k+ users,
					alongside designing a scalable cloud credential management system that enables secure cross-region, cross-cloud data access across 10,000+ enterprise workspaces.
					Through comprehensive monitoring frameworks and change management processes, we've achieved 99.9999% service uptime.

					<h3 id="bair">Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research</h3>
					<span>September 2022 - May 2024</span>
				</header>
				<p>
					As a Graduate Student Researcher in the Berkeley Speech Group, I focused on Differentiable Digital Signal Processing for my Master's research, developing
					a novel real-time data efficient machine learning model for articulatory synthesis. By engineering a streamlined architecture requiring only 0.4M parameters
					(vs. 9M baseline), I improved Word Error Rate by 1.63% (to 6.67%) and Mean Opinion Score by 0.16 (to 3.74) while achieving 4.9x inference speedup on CPU
					compared to state-of-the-art models. This performance improvement enabled real-time applications while maintaining speech quality.
				</p>

				<header>
					<h3 id="spacex">SpaceX</h3>
					<span>May 2022 - August 2022</span>
				</header>
				<p>
					As a Software Engineer Intern at SpaceX, I designed and implemented critical test infrastructure for satellite hardware torque and energy margin verification,
					mitigating flight risks while reducing test time by 10x. This included developing a spectral analysis system leveraging Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)
					to detect and characterize reaction wheel bearing faults, as well as creating a comprehensive test automation suite for flight component qualification that
					integrated hardware control interfaces and data acquisition systems.
				</p>

				<header>
					<h3 id="aws">Amazon Web Services</h3>
					<span>July 2021 - October 2021</span>
				</header>
				<p>
					As an SDE Intern at AWS, I architected and implemented full-stack tooling to automate ML product private offer creation in AWS Marketplace, reducing
					manual engineering effort from hours to minutes. This included building RESTful APIs and implementing database integration for the offer management system,
					while establishing a robust CI/CD pipeline with automated integration testing that significantly improved development tool reliability.
				</p>

				<header>
					<h3 id="mit">MIT Lincoln Laboratory</h3>
					<span>May 2021 - July 2021</span>
				</header>
				<p>
					As a Research Intern at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, I led the design and construction of a custom 4-antenna array system for tracking Lincoln Experimental
					Satellites (LES), achieving successful signal capture at 230 MHz from multiple satellites. By developing and optimizing a Blind Adaptive Beamforming algorithm,
					I was able to isolate and identify satellite signals amid complex co-channel interference, improving signal-to-noise ratio by 30%. The work included implementing
					end-to-end integration testing using phase shifters and RF components to simulate antenna array geometry, with data capture and processing done through
					GNURadio, Python, and MATLAB.
				</p>

				<header>
					<h3 id="ultima">Ultima Genomics</h3>
					<span>May 2020 - May 2021</span>
				</header>
				<p>
					As an Engineering Intern at Ultima Genomics, I developed instrument control software in Python for automated optical system calibration and alignment,
					building a data processing pipeline that integrated multiple sensors and hardware interfaces using Python, MATLAB, and ACS. My work spanned from component
					design through part manufacturing to software implementation, including a real-time monitoring system for laser performance metrics with automated alert triggers.
				</p>

				<header>
					<h3 id="berkeleylab">Berkeley Lab</h3>
					<span>December 2019 - January 2021</span>
				</header>
				<p>
					As a Software Research Assistant at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, I developed an automated testing framework in Python/MATLAB for quantum research
					that reduced experiment runtime by 90%. This involved building a hardware control system that integrated multiple scientific instruments including lasers,
					waveform generators, and sensors, alongside creating a data processing pipeline for experimental results that reduced analysis time by 70% through automation.

					<h3 id="qube">QubeSat</h3>
					<span>Fall 2019 - 2021</span>
				</header>
				<p>
					As part of the mechanical subteam at Space Technologies at Cal, I designed the structure and deployment mechanism while integrating the payload and sensors
					for the CubeSat, using SolidWorks and other software to simulate and test the design. Beyond the mechanical work, I also wrote the flight software for the mission.
					Our goal was to design the first quantum gyroscope fit for space and deploy it on a CubeSat through NASA's CubeSat Launch Initiative—a revolutionary technology
					that offers better precision and accuracy compared to traditional MEMS gyroscopes, making it ideal for deep space missions. QubeSat was successfully flown as part of

					<h3 id="mood">Mood for Zoom</h3>
					<span>Spring 2020</span>
				</header>
				<p>
					During quarantine, my friends and I noticed that professors had trouble engaging with students, so we built Mood for Zoom for LA Hacks—a real-time
					aggregate mood visualization tool to help professors, educators, and meeting leaders "read the room" over Zoom. The project leveraged the Google Cloud
					Vision API to read emotions from faces, PyAutoGUI to continuously capture screenshots, and TkInter to display the visualization. We were awarded 2nd Place
					Overall and an honorable mention for Hack Using Machine Learning.

					<h3 id="senate">Senate Watch</h3>
					<span>Spring 2020</span>
				</header>
				<p>
					The average American knows very little about their representatives and whether their own views are being properly represented, which is why we created Senate Watch—a
					tool that scrapes the official senate.gov website to display voting patterns based on party loyalty. We used beautiful-soup and requests for scraping,
					Python for data processing, and jQuery/JavaScript for the frontend.

					<h3 id="crawler">Crawler Robot</h3>
					<span>Summer 2018</span>
				</header>
				<p>
					At COSMOS in UCSD, I worked on designing a "walking" robot from scratch, ultimately settling on an insectoid design. My partner and I designed the circuitry,
					wrote code for a Raspberry Pi and Adafruit PWM driver, and modeled and 3D printed the chassis. In the final time-based race, our robot beat the other competitors by a margin of 50%.
