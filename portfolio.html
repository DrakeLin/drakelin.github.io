				<header>
					<h3 id="databricks">Databricks</h3>
					<span>August 2023 - Present</span>
				</header>
				<p>
					As a Software Engineer at Databricks, I develop cloud storage and credentials infrastructure powering the SAAS enterprise platform.
					I built an automated multi-cloud blob storage provisioning system managing 1,000,000+ buckets and 500+ TB of customer data, serving 100k+ users.
					I designed a scalable cloud credential management system for secure cross-region, cross-cloud data access across 10,000+ enterprise workspaces.
					I also implemented comprehensive monitoring frameworks and change management processes, achieving 99.9999% service uptime.
				</p>

				<header>
					<h3 id="bair">Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research</h3>
					<span>September 2022 - May 2024</span>
				</header>
				<p>
					As a Graduate Student Researcher in the Berkeley Speech Group, I focused on Differentiable Digital Signal Processing for my Master's research.
					I developed a novel real-time data efficient machine learning model for articulatory synthesis, engineering a streamlined architecture requiring only 0.4M parameters
					(vs. 9M baseline) while improving Word Error Rate by 1.63% (to 6.67%) and Mean Opinion Score by 0.16 (to 3.74).
					I achieved 4.9x inference speedup on CPU compared to State Of The Art models while maintaining speech quality, enabling real-time applications.
				</p>

				<header>
					<h3 id="spacex">SpaceX</h3>
					<span>May 2022 - August 2022</span>
				</header>
				<p>
					As a Software Engineer Intern at SpaceX, I designed and implemented critical test infrastructure for satellite hardware torque and energy margin verification,
					mitigating flight risks and reducing test time by 10x. I developed a spectral analysis system leveraging Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) to detect and
					characterize reaction wheel bearing faults. I also created a comprehensive test automation suite for flight component qualification, integrating hardware
					control interfaces and data acquisition systems.
				</p>

				<header>
					<h3 id="aws">Amazon Web Services</h3>
					<span>July 2021 - October 2021</span>
				</header>
				<p>
					As an SDE Intern at AWS, I architected and implemented full-stack tooling to automate ML product private offer creation in AWS Marketplace, reducing
					manual engineering effort from hours to minutes. I built RESTful APIs and implemented database integration for the offer management system.
					I also established a robust CI/CD pipeline with automated integration testing, significantly improving development tool reliability.
				</p>

				<header>
					<h3 id="mit">MIT Lincoln Laboratory</h3>
					<span>May 2021 - July 2021</span>
				</header>
				<p>
					As a Research Intern at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, I led the design and construction of a custom 4-antenna array system for tracking Lincoln Experimental
					Satellites (LES), achieving successful signal capture at 230 MHz from multiple satellites. I developed and optimized a Blind Adaptive Beamforming algorithm
					to isolate and identify satellite signals amid complex co-channel interference, improving signal-to-noise ratio by 30%. I also implemented end-to-end
					integration testing using phase shifters and RF components to simulate antenna array geometry, capturing and processing data using GNURadio, Python, and MATLAB.
				</p>

				<header>
					<h3 id="ultima">Ultima Genomics</h3>
					<span>May 2020 - May 2021</span>
				</header>
				<p>
					As an Engineering Intern at Ultima Genomics, I developed instrument control software in Python for automated optical system calibration and alignment.
					I built a data processing pipeline integrating multiple sensors and hardware interfaces using Python, MATLAB, and ACS. I also implemented a real-time
					monitoring system for laser performance metrics with automated alert triggers, from component design to part manufacturing to software implementation.
				</p>

				<header>
					<h3 id="berkeleylab">Berkeley Lab</h3>
					<span>December 2019 - January 2021</span>
				</header>
				<p>
					As a Software Research Assistant at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, I developed an automated testing framework in Python/MATLAB for quantum research,
					reducing experiment runtime by 90%. I built a hardware control system integrating multiple scientific instruments (lasers, waveform generators, sensors).
					I also created a data processing pipeline for experimental results, reducing analysis time by 70% through automation.
				</p>

				<header>
					<h3 id="qube">QubeSat</h3>
					<span>Fall 2019 - 2021</span>
				</header>
				<p>
					As a member of Space Technologies at Cal, I worked on the QubeSat mission for 3 semesters, primarily focused on
					the mechanical design, circuitry layout, and optics. Our mission was to design the first quantum gyroscope fit for space and deploy and test it
					on a CubeSat through NASA's CubeSat Launch Initiative. This revolutionary technology gives better precision and accuracy in comparison to
					traditional MEMS gyroscopes, thus making it a better fit for deep space missions.

					<h3 id="mood">Mood for Zoom</h3>
					<span>Spring 2020</span>
				</header>
				<p>
					During quarantine, my friends and I noticed that professors had trouble engaging with students. Thus, for LA Hacks, we built Mood for Zoom,
					a real-time aggregate mood visualization tool to help professors, educators, and meeting leaders "read the room" over
					Zoom. The project used the Google Cloud Vision API to read emotions, PyAutoGUI to continuously take screenshots to input into the API, and TkInter to show the visualization.
					We were awarded 2nd Place Overall and an honorable mention for Hack Using Machine Learning.

					<h3 id="senate">Senate Watch</h3>
					<span>Spring 2020</span>
				</header>
				<p>
					The average American knows very little about their representatives and whether their own views are being properly represented. Senate Watch
					was a tool that scraped the official senate.gov website and displayed voting patterns based on party loyalty. To accomplish this, we used
					beautiful-soup and requests for scraping, Python for data processing, and jquery/javascript for frontend.

					<h3 id="crawler">Crawler Robot</h3>
					<span>Summer 2018</span>
				</header>
				<p>
					At COSMOS in UCSD, I worked on designing a "walking" robot from scratch. After settling on an insectoid design, my partner and I designed the circuitry,
					wrote code on a Raspberry Pi and Adafruit PWM driver, and modeled/3D printed the chassis. In a time-based race, our robot easily beat the other competitors by a margin of 50%.
